I have created a new dataset called "fips.cvs" downloading fips codes from www.nrcs.usda.gov.
I do not fully understand how to use the regions function in the map() package. I wanted to use the county_choropleth() function to create maps. 
county_choropleth() requires fips codes (making the column name "region") and a certain "value" variable. 
To install county_choropleth(), please use install.packages("choroplethrMaps"). R is case sensitive and I spent an hour to find out how to install it.
